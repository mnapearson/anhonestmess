Experiment. That's me. Michaela. I am a young woman, originally from Boston, USA. Currently I am living in Leipzig, Germany. This is a very interesting time in my life, full of exploration, and inward focus and adventure. We are collectively experiencing a huge shift in the way we operate as a human family, and these changes are being felt within and without my universe.

Currently, I am learning to develop websites and applications with a program called Code Camp. That is how this website was born! It will be a continual work in progress, and I am excited to watch its evolution throughout the course as I use it as a playground to try out my new dexterity in the world of coding.
